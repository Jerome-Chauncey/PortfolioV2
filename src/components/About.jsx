        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          I'm a lifelong learner passionate about solving real-world problems using technology, data, and sustainability. My journey spans financial markets trading, cross-border research, and hands-on agricultural ventures like mushroom and lettuce farming. Currently, I'm sharpening my front-end development skills at Moringa School through practical, real-world projects.
