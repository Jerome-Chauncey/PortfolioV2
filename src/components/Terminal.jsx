        I began as a financial markets trader, mastering risk management and data-driven decision making.
        I advanced to project leadership, optimizing workflows and guiding teams to success.
        Venturing into sustainable agriculture, I designed automated farming systems and honed my technical problem-solving.
        Now, as a junior Software Engineering student at Moringa School, I develop user-centered web applications using
        HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React, and I am eager to gain hands-on experience in real-world projects.
